## Introduction

Breast cancer remains a significant health concern globally, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze diagnostic features and predict breast cancer diagnosis outcomes.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with correlation matrix visualization
- Model training using logistic regression
- Model evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix

## Installation

To run the script, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/breast-cancer-diagnosis.git
```

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd breast-cancer-diagnosis
python breast_cancer_diagnosis.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to explore the dataset, visualize the correlation matrix, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The trained model achieves promising results in predicting breast cancer diagnosis outcomes. Check the classification report and confusion matrix in the terminal/console output for detailed performance metrics.
